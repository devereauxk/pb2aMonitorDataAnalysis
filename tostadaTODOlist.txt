what to look at in tostada:

data wrt time (and over discrete periods)
stds vars wrt time (and over discrete periods)

focal plane. specifically,
stability of focal plane temp over observations

help with chile work?
50K shell

questions:
what happens in between the runs and sub_runs
	(should I only consider data over single runs,
		or is considering data over multiple runs ok?)

meeting:
recently got a new laptop, so I spent some time finding out how to ssh into tostada with it. Eventually,
I figured out how to use by old machine to add my new public key to the server's authorized keys, and that worked
Yeah, so it was fun learning how all that works
