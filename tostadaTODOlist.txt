=================== current

to test:
run previous tests but for x_axis=az and az_acc and az_amp? - DONE
	no x_axis=az significant findings
	looks like two sets of correlations emerging
		1) two horizontal lines
		2) clusters and logistics
run previous tests but for run_ids before retrofit (and compare)
THATS ENOUGH! SEND THIS TO TYLOR
continue: do the above but for MOST RECENT data (the above is just with John's initial vibration tests, remember)
revist all observations from first two studies, see if new data provides insight
check is heating persists at 50K shell, if persists, keep going outwards shell by shell until source found (maybe weather (last shell)?)

-4k backend data reads -1 for post retrofit
-az_sun is prop to -time
-some monitor data nonexistent for run 22300417
-no focal plane data for 223***** runds


limit slew 4*/s

see if delta T dibbles off for small <0.6 d/s az speed

.sch (schedule) files contain telescope movement commands
locate the .sch files - they are in many usr's home dirs

locate the delta T data

get on mailing list
find out how to speak/sign up for presentations in meeting

instrument stability has always been a problem

.gz	gzip compressing, use gzip -d in ubuntu to decompress
.tar 	tar ubuntu command
.dat
.db
.g3

what are the ...
	.dat.gz files in gcp
	.g3 files in g3 compressed
	.tar.gz files in tuning logs
	.gz files in slowdaq!!!


===================


what to look at in tostada:

data wrt time (and over discrete periods)
stds vars wrt time (and over discrete periods)

focal plane. specifically,
stability of focal plane temp over observations

help with chile work?
50K shell

questions:
what happens in between the runs and sub_runs
	(should I only consider data over single runs,
		or is considering data over multiple runs ok?)
