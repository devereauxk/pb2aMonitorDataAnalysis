=================== current

some monitor data nonexistent for run 22300417
no focal plane data for 223***** runds


limit slew 4*/s

see if delta T dibbles off for small <0.6 d/s az speed

.sch (schedule) files contain telescope movement commands


===================


what to look at in tostada:

data wrt time (and over discrete periods)
stds vars wrt time (and over discrete periods)

focal plane. specifically,
stability of focal plane temp over observations

help with chile work?
50K shell

questions:
what happens in between the runs and sub_runs
	(should I only consider data over single runs,
		or is considering data over multiple runs ok?)
