=================== current

to test:

"
I've been reasoning that the components which experience similar heating as the focal plane are more likely to be related to it - narrowing the search for the vibrations/heat source.

From here, I plan to consider all the post retrofit data in the dbs and incorporate the actual focal plane data. I'm also working on some other slides showing general differences between pre and post-retrofit component temperatures. I should be done with those soon.
"

quick summary of changes in componenet temperatures



continue: do the above but for MOST RECENT data (the above is just with John's initial vibration tests, remember)
revist all observations from first two studies, see if new data provides insight
check is heating persists at 50K shell, if persists, keep going outwards shell by shell until source found (maybe weather (last shell)?)

-4k backend data reads -1 for post retrofit
-az_sun is prop to -time
-some monitor data nonexistent for run 22300417
-no focal plane data for 223***** runds
-az_amp related to el somehow


limit slew 4*/s

see if delta T dibbles off for small <0.6 d/s az speed

.sch (schedule) files contain telescope movement commands
locate the .sch files - they are in many usr's home dirs

locate the delta T data

get on mailing list
find out how to speak/sign up for presentations in meeting

instrument stability has always been a problem

.gz	gzip compressing, use gzip -d in ubuntu to decompress
.tar 	tar ubuntu command
.dat
.db
.g3

what are the ...
	.dat.gz files in gcp
	.g3 files in g3 compressed
	.tar.gz files in tuning logs
	.gz files in slowdaq!!!


===================


what to look at in tostada:

data wrt time (and over discrete periods)
stds vars wrt time (and over discrete periods)

focal plane. specifically,
stability of focal plane temp over observations

help with chile work?
50K shell

questions:
what happens in between the runs and sub_runs
	(should I only consider data over single runs,
		or is considering data over multiple runs ok?)
