is there anything specific i should be doing

where can i read about tes bolometers, dfmux, squid

dfmux (multiplexing) - how read out works

frequncies (90/150Hz), why not range of all microwave frequencies
dichroic

how does the half wave plate relate to B mode polarization

how does the read out info relate to the data files ive found
	|
	V
How to make image of venus
tuning file?



bolometer info papers
kent urwin
thesis adrian lab
historical paul richard



urap

what should i be doing
maybe help him with simons array data analysis

generic questions
how does the read out info relate to the data files ive found
polarization
	how does b-mode and e-mode poalrization manifest in data
	is the incident light all types of polarization
	how does the change in polarization from the CHWP decrease noise 

opamp - feedback read feedback voltage

files on real database, not this database.

make summary send to john tyler, slides with histograms
people would have suggestions, on which items to analyse

EB comes from patterns of QU polarization (QU across the field of view (whole sky)
polarization field is tensor field 180 degree rotaion symmmetry, 1/2 spin particles have 720 degree symmetry
vector has 360 rotation symmetry
every point of the sky has a tensor accossiated with it
tensor version of divergence, curl -> div component is E-mode and B-mode is curl compontnet
qu meansurements define the tensor at a point
gravity waves create e-mode and b-mode, only gravity creates b-modes
